Restito 0.9.x and later is written with Java 8 and will require the project to use Java 8 as well. 
Besides that, most of the end users will not even notice the difference as the main API stays fully backwards compatible, 
unless they created custom actions, or used some internal classes/interfaces.

## Functional interfaces

There are some legacy functional interfaces, originally from Guava, that can be replaced with lambda expressions:

* `com.xebialabs.restito.semantics.Function` - replace all the occurrences with lambda expressions, or with `java.util.function.Function`.
* `com.xebialabs.restito.semantics.Predicate` - replace all the occurrences with lambda expressions, or with `java.util.function.Predicate`.

## Removed some deprecated/unused methods

* `com.xebialabs.restito.support.behavior.Behavior` and the `StubServer` constructor which depends on it... It wasn't really documented, don't think anyone will miss it.
